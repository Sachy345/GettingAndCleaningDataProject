# Getting And Cleaning Data Project

For this final project for the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data, analysis was done to calculate the averages of the mean and standard deviation for each variable for each activity and subject.

This project focuses on using the R Package dplyr to combine, extract and manipulate data sets. The file "run_analysis.R" performs the data clean and analysis. 

## Data Set

The final data set is comprised of the following files:\

-   'features.txt': List of all features.
